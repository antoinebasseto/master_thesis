Mrs. Johnsonâ€™s prized diamond necklace vanished from her jewelry box during her tea party. 

Mrs. Johnson knows the necklace was still there at 3pm because she saw it, but when she returned 30 minutes later it had disappeared.
Some dirt had been dragged onto the floor.

No guests left during that timeframe, and only Mrs. Carter and Mr. Lindsay were still present.

Mr. Lindsay is a jewelry enthusiast, and loves diamonds. He spent the entire party inside, away from the sun.
Mrs. Carter loves gardening and went to look at the flower beds alone before re-joining the party inside.

Who is the culprit?
