A 48-year-old man presented to hospital after onset 1 hour previously of white “sparkles” flickering in the vision of the left eye, followed by sudden blurriness which worsened and became ‘dark’ such that that he could not see a hand in front of his face when he covered the right eye. He had no floaters or eye pain. On arrival, vision in the left eye was improving but remained blurry. A review of systems was notable for fatigue and weight loss of 4.5 kg in the past year, which the patient attributed to inactivity and decreased appetite. He had a 2-month history of bilateral jaw pain with chewing of firm foods but not with soft foods. There was lateral hip soreness in both hips after walking but no stiffness. Two days prior, he had suffered a temporal headache on the right side that resolved. He reported no numbness or weakness. He had no other past history of note, was a non-smoker and non-drinker, was on no medications, and had no family history. 

On examination, he was afebrile, blood pressure 120/65 mm Hg, heart rate 92 beats per minute, and BMI 24.2. Visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye but limited to hand motions at 0.9 m (3.0 ft) in the left eye.  Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, with no afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular movements were intact, visual fields were full to confrontation and Ishihara colour test was normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal optic disks, maculae, and vessels.  Intraocular pressures and slit-lamp examination were normal bilaterally. Severe ptosis of the left upper eyelid was noted together with a nontender, irregular mass palpable under the left superior orbital rim, but with no proptosis. There was no tenderness of the scalp, temporal arteries (although prominent) or temporomandibular joints. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Initial investigations revealed normocytic anaemia (Hb 116), normal WCC and platelets, ESR 58, CRP 12. Liver transaminases were all elevated: ALT 245 (10-55), AST 154 (10-40), ALP 1924 (45-115) with elevated total bilirubin 48 (0-20), all indirect. Serum albumen, INR, globulins and the rest of the biochemical profile were normal. Thyroid function tests, creatine kinase and ANA were normal. MRI scan  of the head and orbits revealed normal brain but enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle with stranding of the adjacent extraconal fat, as well as an enhancing mass-like lesion in the left anterior superior orbit. Ultrasound of the temporal arteries was normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen
revealed markedly heterogeneous liver parenchyma. CT of the abdomen with IV contrast revealed multiple punctate calcifications throughout the liver, hypoattenuation of the right hepatic lobe, and diffuse coalescent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy with coarse calcifications.
