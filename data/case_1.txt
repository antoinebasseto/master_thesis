A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department with dizziness, feeling ‘weird’ and altered mental status, having been found crawling on a city sidewalk. He had difficulty recalling recent events but reported shortness of breath, chronic back pain, and persistent ringing in his ears. He had a past history of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, seizure disorder, chronic back pain due to spinal stenosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and anxiety. Prescribed medications included lisinopril, paracetamol, metformin, sitagliptin and pantoprazole. He was a non-drinker, non-smoker and did not use illicit drugs. No family history was available.

On examination, he appeared pale and diaphoretic. A fingerstick blood glucose level was 8.4 mmol/L. Temperature was 36.6°C, heart rate 92 beats per minute, blood pressure 183/113 mm Hg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. He was somnolent but awakened to verbal stimuli and was oriented to person, place, and time. There was no neck stiffness or other neurological signs, including no cerebellar signs. There was mild tenderness on palpation of the midback but no other evidence of trauma. The remainder of the examination was normal.

Initial investigations showed mild anaemia (Hb 122) with normal white cell count and platelets. Biochemistry revealed elevated serum creatinine (141) and reduced eGFR (45), elevated glucose (10.5) low corrected serum calcium (1.95), with otherwise normal profile, including albumin, phosphate, magnesium, lipase, serum osmolality and BNP. Serum ethanol and urinary drug screen were negative. ESR and CRP were normal. Urinalysis showed 2+ ketones but no protein. Microurine revealed microscopic haematuria, with no white cells or nitrites. Chest X-ray and ECG were unremarkable. Arterial blood gases on rom air showed pH 7.5, pO2 85, pCO2 21, HCO3 16. CT scan of the brain showed only non-specific white matter changes, with MRI showing no other changes. EEG was normal.  CT angiography of the head and neck revealed mild atherosclerosis without any significant stenoses. Blood and urine cultures were negative.
